Piter i-pit! Piter i-pit!

Peter walked out the door and down the block. He walked randomly, without a choice of direction, as if some other force were guiding him.

After about one hour he rested. Then he got up again and started walking, but this time he walked slower, and with his shoulders a few degrees lower towards the black empty street concrete.

He walked into a neighbourhood that was a bit more religious. Not extremely religious, and many in the neighbourhood were not religious, but there were some nevertheless.

A word about peter's town. It is a town with ancient history. Most of the history is religious and throughout the years there have been very important leaders from main religions, but the residents today were a mix. Peter's family lived in a suburb mostly occupied by wealthy, liberal, and secular people. But during his walk, he came closer to the city's centre, which was more of a religious hub. He did not get to the radical religious places but he did get to one quiet neighbourhood where the secular and the non-secular were mixed together and lived in relative harmony.

As he walked down a street in this neighborhood. He did no realise it but it was the street where his grandparents used to live when he was a boy. What he did realize, was that the streets were empty and that almost every window showed light from within the apartments in which people were living. This made him walk even slower. As he walked the evening air seemed to take a silent flow. It felt smooth on Peters face and he noticed its smoothness. There was a clean feeling to the atmosphere. There were no cars in the street. He was walking in the middle of the street. There were no cars in the street nor a sound of any approaching. All he heard was Friday evening prayer.

As he walked he observed the buildings. They were made of Jerusalem stone, as was (and still is) the law in Jerusalem. He observed every house he passed by. They looked different but in each one of them the same thing was happening - people stuck indoors waiting for the wretched virus to end. On any other day, Peter would have imagined that the people in those apartments were binging away on Netflix shows, remembering their shitty lives and the shitty world they come to see get destroyed before their eyes before the next episode. Or maybe, Peter thought, 'the world is also getting fixed. I mean, didn't we need this? Is this not some sort of restart for humanity? A cleansing? No cars anywhere in the world are being driven. I wonder what that girl Greta is thinking in her head these days. She must be very happy'.

It was thoughts like this that Peter was thinking as he walked down this street. With the diminishing of the thoughts, an increase of a noise of singing was heard by Peter. He instinctively walked towards the singing voices, as they were luring in their presence.

After about two dozen meters, Peter came to an increasingly slow halt.

Remember, that Peter was still wearing sweatpants and one of his most ragged shirts. He loved this shirt and he would wear it for many more years to come. It would get more ragged and dirty with the years. He also still had his vans shoes in one hand, yes, he was still wearing vans flip flops with socks, and his mini bluetooth speaker in the other hand.

Peter halted in front of a house that was shaped like the obtuse angle of a triangle, if you were looking at it from a viewpoint around the centre of the hypotenuse.

Something like this:

Where the dot is Peter and the two lines (without the arrow) are the buildings.

Like the other buildings, this one also had many balconies with their light open. But this one had balconies that were all facing Peter.

A man dressed in white, with nice pants and a nice shirt was standing below the building with a book in his hands. He was facing the building and swaying from side to side in prayer. He sang the Friday evening prayers with an American accent. This immediately drew Peters subconscious attention, since he himself had had his bar mitzvah in the US with an American jewish rabbi with a similar accent, though back then he did not much care about it. But now he stood and watched, as if mesmerised. There were about 5 floors to the building, and in each floor and on each wing of the building, there were a few people in their balconies, about one or two in each level - so there were about 8-9 in total, singing the prayers after the man who led the prayer.

Peter did not know the prayers, he never bothered to learn them for he did not care much and his biblical hebrew was never strong enough. Though we cannot say he was never uninterested in religion completely.

Peter stood and watched as the men held their service. He tried to watch all the balconies equally. They all were equally interesting to him. Sometimes a small child, girl or boy would come to the balcony and look at what was happening. The children usually lost interest in this quite quickly, and either went back inside to find a new object of interest. The creative and the curious ones, would find objects of interest also in the balcony. Curious children found interesting things endlessly, Peter was like this as a child. And in a way he still was like this today. Was peter's stop in front of this house and this scene not like an object grabbing a child's attention?

Sometimes wives of the men who prayed would open a balcony door as well. Peter could not figure out what they wanted or why they opened the door, but he was at least quite sure that it was not for the same reasons the children were opening the doors.

The leading man kept singing, and then he stopped, and they were praying in silence. This happened in intervals, and Peter never could guess when the man would start singing or praying again. This excited him, and later he thought that this was a feature of the scene that made him stay - there was an interesting element of unpredictability to prayer if you did not know it before, as Peter had not.

Then a woman started walking towards him from the other side of the street. There was a young women before but she was not very interesting, she just walked by and looked strangely at Peter, not understanding what he was standing there and watching. I think there was too much shit on her mind to enable her to understand why someone dressed like Peter would stand by and watch something of the sort. No, she was not interesting. An older woman that came a few minutes after was the interesting one. She observed peter, and she was a woman of age and wisdom and she identified objects of interest quite well by now. She and Peter moved a bit to keep their distance from one another to not infect or get infected. After a few steps, the older woman stopped and looked as well. They were together in their obtrusiveness of the scene.

The woman sang lightly when the men would sing. Peter was the only quite participant. He did not know the words. But he did not need them. Tears came to his eyes when he heard the woman sing next to him with the band of men. They were the most bold sound that was there in the moment, and there was an intensity to it. Peter cried like he had not in many many years. This was the first of many times Peter would cry in strange and special moments such as this. Moments that are deeply connected with the most basic roots of humanity.

The leading man finished and the men in the balconies were scheduling the morning prayer for tomorrow. At this point Peter started walking away. He did not want to be noticed. With tears still in his eyes he kept walking down the road, thinking 'maybe ill join them again in the morning. That would be nice.'

\*\*\*NEXT CHAPTER - Peter turns around and walks far into the other direction. Going close to his house but not near to it.
