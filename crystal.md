## Words about words

A wave of sound is every word. The act of speaking echoes meaning in the minds of others. It carries a passage of where we want to go. Yet who knows what meaning is? 
One sometimes point: 
                                           "Look! A drop! It's falling." 
But One doesn't know, if that means rain. So fast the meaning seems to drain. Oneself has never truely understood the full scope of two opposites. Live and Death - Sadness and Joy - symbiont and parasite. Like a whirl One circles around.
But through those opposites One gets a path to phantasy. A world, how it could not be. One has to love the freedom of flying through the clouds. One meets cloudpeople and they tell One different ways to fly.
But one day One finds a true way of speaking. It was in Ones name:
The One. 
What does that mean One asks?
One has found the first thought. There is One and the other. This seperates with words, the world into things.
Let's take a thing. An arbitrary One: The crystal
One finds when One looks at Oneself, Oneself is an abstraction. But when One thinks about Oneself, Oneself becomes a thing. Selfs don't like to be things but thats the path One chooses. One might realise, on the way, that infinity is where Ones path is heading. A crystal inside a crystal inside a crystal, on forever... Is this Ones true self?
Is this not just counting? 
One might be right, there is an infinity of numbers. But they are structured they entail a whole network of relations between them. A snowflake out of crystals if you will. 
But One craves more and feels more. One feels that One means more.
One feels quite strongly that Ones feelings mean something. That Oneself could be a source of Ones dreams. Create Ones dream to live in phantasy.
A journey of passages of moments Ones live a flow gently down the river of a dreamed live. One channels those flows in time and place to create our lovely little bubbles. But finaly on the shore, One can only tell you that this was but a joke. Noise.
