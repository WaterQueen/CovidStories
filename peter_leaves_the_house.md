It was nighttime when Peter left the house. He took nothing but a pair of shoes in one hand, and his Bose mini bluetooth speaker in the other. He was wearing socks with sandals. The sandals were good, and he could walk some miles with them. Peter was still young, and the affect of this behaviour would not be acknowledged by him until his later years.

Before Peter left the house, he first left his room. Before he left his room, he was sitting on the computer. He was listening to very cold and very dark Norwegian metal music from the nineteen-nineties. Darkthrone was the name of the band that he was listening to at that moment. He had loved them for a few years now. But he listened to them only sometimes. At other times they were unendurable to him.

He knew he was not one of many who listened to such music. The sound of it was uneasy to ingest.

He remembered the first time he heard Norwegian black metal. He heard an artist named Burzum. A Norwegian musician who pioneered the genre along with its notorious history. The man behind the one man music project used to burn churches. Burzum supposedly believed that Christianity had destroyed the traditional Nordic mythology and religion that was in the area around the Viking era and prior to it. He also murdered his bandmate with 27 stab wounds.

Peter did not know these details back then. He only listened to the music. He was disgusted and distraught at the music and it made his head ache and his heart feel dizzy. He asked his roommate who introduced it to him to turn it off after 30 seconds of consecutive listening.

Despite his deep immediate disgust, Peter knew he would go back and try listening to this music again at some point. Because as much as it was unbelievably difficult to listen to, it interested him immensely. After about a year or so, he fell in love with the sound.

Peter beloved that you must work and endure some amount of suffering before you can bring yourself to enjoy something. He learned this through music. His favourite music was in fact music that he had hated at first.

He was also like this with his friends. Some of his best friends were people that he had very much hated at first. They may have even been his enemies. But they interested him.

That same night he left the house, he felt very distant from himself. This was a feeling not unknown to him, and not unwelcome, rather it was much the opposite.

He values such moments, and he liked to record them or make something of them usually. He resolved to sit down at the computer and write in his diary.

After a few minutes he noticed that all he was doing was swaying back and forth in front of the computer keyboard, after having written nothing.

He felt his lower back hurt. He knew it was from too much sitting down.

Since the pandemic broke, he rarely left his room. At first he was thrilled about it. It was all he wanted to do. Stay in his room, research online. Explore the vast amount of information swimming out there. Maybe add new information to it. His greatest pain was that he painfully wanted to create new information to the world but he truly did not know what information. And the times he did think of ideas or stories or pictures or poems or applicative scientific thoughts, he knew they were useless. For there were outgoing businessmen who truly had the energy and the skills togo through such acts, energy and skills that he himself had lacked. Or maybe it was not so that he lacked them. But he did not know how to channel them. And so the outcome was that he believed he had terrific artistic and scientific ideas but neither the will or the ability or the *decisiveness* to pull through with them*.*

While typing away on the computer (at this point he was typing nonsense in order to feel as if he wasn't wasting time), his face fell forward. He became delusional. The world started to close in on him with a black shadow. He could only see the keyboard, but was not able to grasp its role w.r.t his own body at that moment. The music was there, Darkthrone. He loved it. It let him disconnect when he needed to. Art that makes one disconnect is truly the most revered of arts. It is not only not boring, but it makes one lose interest in everything else and focus into the inner energies that he himself feels while listening to the music. Immersive. Immersive. This is why he loved metal music. It was very immersive.

'damn my back still hurts'

'Shut up, you must do yoga. You must move. You can take control of your life. You know exactly what you need to do in order to be happy and succeed. You know exactly how to do it. How many books have you read of the matter?' (Peter's speaks in his head).

The sounds were making him swim. Swim in their blackened distorted greatness.
