He went through the first path.

No, no.

He had to go back. He wanted to go back. He moved forward. Taking with him his confusion and guilt at having failed to be decisive. Peter was aware of two types of confusion that he was dealing with: present confusion and past confusion.

Peter was 25 years old. Fellows from previous generations may establish amongst themselves that Peter is not within the age range considered as that of a child. This is only partly true.

With regards to the classification of age groups, Peter was born into a transitional generation - the mid-nineties. He grew up knowing that there was a good chance he would make it to live over the age of one hundred.

Sometimes he would fantasise that he'd live much longer, even indefinitely longer. He rarely felt comfortable with such thoughts.

Such hopeful thoughts were dangerous, he thought, especially when their probability of actually happening was quite unpredictable, and he knew that the chances of him living forever were unpredictable. In truth they were very low, and Peter knew that, but he had stored the acknowledgment of it in an area of his mind that he visited rarely. He knew this area of the mind never yielded much good. He usually tried to avoid it.

Peter's mind was divided into several parts. That's how he saw it. I see how it helped him make order of himself. The area we just mentioned, the area that thoughts of living on forever and their peers would inhabit, flourished quite magnificently as Peter paid them more attention.

I beg you to keep this in mind as we continue unto the path Peter had decided to walk through. Picture the confusion sitting as a triangle on his heart. Something like this: (\*\*INSERT PIC\*\*)

If you had been wondering until now, *how* many paths were there into the forest? Well, imagine standing at the edge of a forest, and walking in a certain direction. That direction directs your path. Peter was very anxious before the choice of his direction. He had only started moving when he felt an urge he did not stay to understand, urging him to move in some direction. And he had taken what he was given.

Where the left shape is the heart and the triangle is the confusion. The two lines are the lines of Peters body. As you can see, his figure was quite slim. His heart was big, and so was his confusion.

We had said earlier that Peter was not aware of his confusion or the size of it for most of his life.

But what is interesting in this exact time in Peters life, is that he slowly started to understand his confusion while taking the path that he decided to take into the forest.

About 3 months before Peter had reached the entrance to the forest, a strange virus had broken out. First it was in a city in [C]{dir="rtl"}hina. Peter did not know the name of the city, it never bothered him. It never bothered him that the virus started in China either. The country of China, its history, [ ]{dir="rtl"} heritage, and culture, were also things that he never bothered to question. It was not because he was uncurious. In fact, I've seen Peter's curiosity proven several times. He did not try to prove it ever, but one proves best when one does so without intention.

Without questioning where the virus came from, and how it arrived to his country, then city, then household, Peter had contracted the virus. This also, he was not aware of. There were a few days when Peter felt sick, he laid in bed and stayed in his room, watching streets slowly emptying outside his window. During these few days, Peter did not feel well. I was also during these days that his countries government decided to impose the strictest of restrictions:

No one was allowed to leave the house for any reason other than buying groceries or necessities.

No one was allowed to be walking in a distance of over 100 meters from their house, unless they were going to buy groceries or necessities.

No one was allowed to come within 2 meter distance of any other person.

There were a few more rules, but they were less interesting.

The thing Peter loved most was watching people walk on the street, scarce as they were but still not too rare. He would see about 20-50 people through the view of the street he had from his room in one hour, and so the situation for seeing action was not utterly hopeless.

Peter really loved to see two people, coming from different directions towards one another. When people walked the streets in these times of the corona virus, they would usually behave in one of two ways. It was either they were looking into their cellphones while walking, sometimes texting in it as well, or they were looking around, very wary of coming into contact with other people. There were also some more categories of people, one time Peter thought about it and came to a conclusion that there must be an infinite number of such categories of people.

Then he remembered that there were not an infinite amount of people living in the world and walking the streets during these times.

'Then again' he thought, 'there are probably an infinite number of such *potential* categories for people'.

He based this theory on the understanding he had reached during sometime in the past few years. He did not remember the exact moment of time where he had reached the conclusion of this theory, rather he remembered it as being understood slowly and in a continuous manner throughout a certain period of time within those past three years, the intervals themselves were continuous, but there were breaks between them as well.

For those familiar with the ideas of mathematics, you could see that the way Peter's mind worked was naturally quite mathematical. He did not know this fact. He did not know what mathematics was really, it was not something he paid attention to in school either. But it was something that added to his confusion. It was also a thing that sometimes helped him deal with confusion. The trouble was that he did not know in what settings to apply these ways of thinking. Of course he was also unaware of the idea that one could apply different ways of thinking towards different subjects of thought.

I hope I have not confused my reader too much. I am merely trying to get you comfortable with the character of Peter, and with his peculiar mind. It is important to not try too hard to understand the character of Peter. I myself learned this after many more years than a multiple of Peter's own age. Today I believe it is quite impossible to understand another character. Thus, it is very challenging for me to write about Peter, as I myself do not understand him very well, but I will try my best to transfer to you what I have seen of him as the story moves on.

While feeling ill, Peter did come out of his room several times. He lived in a house made mostly of wood. His parents and his little sister also lived in the house. The house was spacious, and family members could spend hours, even a full day, without seeing or hearing one another. There were no grudges held in the household, there were no enemies, it was simply the way it was. To this day I do not know who it is in a family household that decides upon these rules of behaviour.

The first time Peter left his room during his illness, was to go and eat downstairs. In the kitchen, he met his sister Martha, and without being very aware of it, he had infected her with the virus. Martha herself never knew she had contracted the virus, but for all of her life she had felt guilt for passing the virus on to both of her parents.

Peter and Martha's parents had fallen ill about ten days after Peter's days of sickness. They stayed ill in their room. There was no other room in the house where they decided it was ok for them to be. The house was large, but it was very unfurnished, and so there was no other place for them to be ill comfortably. The parents stayed sick for two weeks in the room. Martha would cook eggs and bread for them. Peter would bring them snacks and tea, he never tried to cook, although I believe he would have made a talented cook had he tried.

There is another detail about Peter we should briefly discuss at this point. Peter was very talented, but he was afraid of gaining new skill. He was afraid of truly understanding something foreign. There is a subtle point here. We mentioned before that Peter was a curious boy. Being a curious boy, Peter had an adventurous nature. He liked to see and explore many things. He liked to touch and play with many things. But he would quickly become disinterested in one activity, and move on to another.

Despite his curiosity, Peter was afraid to dive too deep into a certain subject, for his fear that he would not be able to understand it. So it was with cooking. He had never turned on the stove, he did not know how the machines in the kitchen worked, and what to put in them. If he had read instructions he would have done just fine. Such an act was also stored in the same chamber where he stored the fact of low chance that he would live forever, though in a different area of the chamber.

On the fifteenth day after Peters parents had contracted the virus, Peters father died.

**Chapter II**

Before we talk about the death of Peter and Martha's father, and its effect on the Irving family household, there is another attribute of peter's that we must talk about.

The talk about Peter lately in the household, was that he spent most of his time "preparing ground". It was Martha who had realised this and come up with the label. Peter was not aware of the label, nor of the fact that Martha had been observing him in this or in anything at all.

Martha's theory was, that Peter enjoyed to make preparations for ideas. sometimes, the preparations themselves had multiple ideas within them, and so they would change the grand idea that invoked them into necessary existence.

Martha had always been suspicious of this in peter. He would always throw around many ideas. Sometimes he seemed obsessed with them, but only for a short period of time. The longest period being about six months. This was when Peter hosted a chess website. He hosted games in it. He had convinced some online chess friends that it would be a good idea to record their games, with him commentating in the background. The idea was not firstly hatched by him, I am sure of it, but once in every unpredictable interval of time, Peter would have an idea for a new feature in his website. This could happen one day, then again a week later, then maybe 2 weeks later for 3 days in a row of new ideas.

It can be said that tracking Peter is not an easy task. And so Peter had created the website, and had gotten some friends to play once a week on it, but it did not turn out to be a success.

The reason was mainly due to Peters new ideas, overriding needed energy of his into the previous ideas in order for them to work.

This was so in everything that Peter did. He had many ideas, and he loved having them. He loved planning their execution. But the executing itself was not for him. Hence Martha had given him that nickname.

Martha herself was a bright child. She had bright blond hair cut short, as that of a toddler, only she was several years older. Peter loved martha, but he did not know what to do with this love for her. He did not know that it was love at all. Love was a word he heard a lot but did not comprehend. To try to understand it was a mission stored in that chamber we have already mentioned twice previously in the story.

Martha was very keen on her mysterious older brother. She had heard from other girls at school about their older brothers. Some girls had complained of their older brothers picking on them, sometimes even hurting them. Some boasted of older brothers who were gentler and played with them, took them to activities and talked to them.

It was during these conversations that Martha had felt most aloof. Usually she was quite cheerful. She was not the most talkative of the girls in her school. But she was the most observant, and she new when to talk and when not too. She rarely was mistaken in her timing. But when the girls started talking about their brothers, she would shy away. They all knew that Martha had an older brother and that he was quite strange, and being a good group of girls that they were, for Martha chose her friends well, they knew not to ask her much about her brother. It was her awareness of their behaviour towards her the case of her and her brother that made her so uneasy. She really never had anything to say about her brother. He was one of the few people that she did not understans, not even a little bit.

And so, it was with this newly developed theory of "ground preparation" that Martha made her first breakthrough with Peter. And she was very excited about it.

(Note - please create a storyline here)

The family did not know how to deal with the fathers death. The father was the source of income. Instead of being a man, Peter secluded himself in his room. Until one day he went for a walk, it was towards the end of the lockdown phase in his country. But at the moment he left the house he truly believed lockdown would not end soon. And that if he went alone outside it truly wouldn't matter if he stayed away from people. He had resolved to keep a 20 meter distance from every person he would see, that way he would not die as his father had. Of course, at this point he was not aware of the fact that he had already lived through the attack of the virus on his body.

It took a month for Peter to leave the house. It was a difficult month for the family.

Agnes, Peter's mother had locked herself in her room to weep after the death of her husband William. Five days after the death of William, Agnes's father died tragically of a heart attack. This deepened Agnes's grievance. Agnes was not a woman of particularly strong character. She was wrecked.

Agnes had wept without break for one month. After William's death, the three remaining members of the household had stopped taking regard of time. Days would go uncounted. No one worked, only little Martha still had school. But even Martha had been beaten to depression.

During this particularly blackened month, Agnes had barely left her room and did not talk to the children at all. Martha tried to comfort her, but after being yelled at when she opened the door to her mother's room several times, she had given up hope. Having no further ideas, she had left her mother alone.

We had already mentioned that Martha was exceptionally bright as a child, but, she was not the creative type. While Agnes was in deep depression, and Peter was in his own fantasy world, Martha had trouble finding what to do with herself. She did her lessons online, and being a good student shed finish her days early, already having done her homework. As she was not a creative type, nor the type that liked to spend time mindlessly watching television or going about social media online, she would walk around clueless and bored. She would make tea and cookies and food for her mother. She would care for her as much as she could although she was young and did not know enough to take care of a middle age woman in deep depression, and so nurturing her mother was not a time consuming enough activity to fill her schedule.

She had tried to also play with Peter but he always kept himself isolated in his room.

For a few days she tried to watch Netflix after school or be on YouTube and social media but she quickly grew bored. She was very sad about the death of her father and grandfather, but being a pragmatic type, she knew there was no help of any cause weeping over them. She resolved to weep at night before the nights sleep. She knew that positive energies were needed in the morning and so she would use up all the bad ones at night time.

What Martha did not expect, was to be thinking of Peter and his buiseness. She found herself increasingly thinking about what Peter was up to in his room.

Martha was good at solving problems. Peter was good at creating them. To martha, Peter as a whole was the most interesting problem in her life.

After Peter had left the house to go to the
